# “MuscleWatch Source Code”

This is the source code for my “MuscleWatch device” which aims to prevent hamstring injury along with the Neuromuscular Training (NMT) warm up program developed by researchers at the University of Calgary.

Each of the 3 folders contains the machine learning model for each NMT warm up exercise, code, and EMG data used to train it. The arduino code is run on the leg sleeve of the physical device and is used to filter and relay the EMG data to either of the 3 machine learning models (found in folders: APB, NHC, and SQJ). If you find any errors, feel free to open up an “issue” or send a “pull request”! 

Deployment Date: February 14, 2025

For inspiring the idea to modify the threshold line at which the result of my machine learning model is considered a positive or a negative. This helped me increase the accuracy of my model when tested on the validation and testing data sets.
